Recently, I realised that I __really__ like mechanical watches (thanks to the excellent [Watch and Listen podcast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkWjQdK8RBD1rpJT3Pmajvw)). Unlike most modern watches, which use electronics to keep time and therefore need a battery, mechanical watches actually contain tiny moving metal parts and jewels that keep time by slowly releasing mechanical energy that was put into the watch by the person wearing it. It doesn't take much imagination to think of mechanical watches as living beings themselves, as they (almost) literally have a beating heart. This beating heart, the *escapement*, releases the tension of a wound spring in very small steps. In doing so, it produces audible ticks. These ticks can of course be picked up by a microphone, and by analysing the resulting pulses in the waveform we can get an idea about the general 'health' of a watch. You can actually buy a machine that does this, a so-called *timegrapher*, for around 100-150 euros. Such a machine would be particularly useful if you were to buy a lot of cheap vintage watches on *ebay* (hypothetically speaking of course). But for 100-150 euros, you could also buy even more (hypothetical) vintage watches! And how hard could it be to make your own timegrapher!?

As a linguistics student and a research assistant, I have often used a computer program called [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) for its intended purpose: the acoustic analysis of speech. However, because Praat is highly programmable you can pretty much use it to analyse any sound. Like the ticks made by a watch for example!

To start with, I pressed my watch (a Seiko 7S26-02J0) against the microphone of my laptop, pressed record and took a look at the resulting waveform:

insert picture, use picture to illustrate the relevant measurements

For me, mechanical timepieces show that long before the digital era people were making sense of the world by turning continuous concepts like *time* into discrete elements. Moreover, i
